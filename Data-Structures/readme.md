# Data-Structures

## Definition

It is termed as a collection of data or pieces of information,a relationship is being established among each and every piece of data and various functions(operations) can be applied on the pieces of data.

## List of Data Structures
* Arrays
* Single linked lists
* Double linked lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Binaray search trees
* Graphs
* Binary Heaps
* Hash tables


## Why so many Data Structures

Each and every data structure have their own application and each of them excel or work differently in different situations.
  
  * If we are working with the maps/location data,the best way of doing is by using **graphs** . 
  * If we have list of items and if we want to have faster insertion and deletion of items at the beginning and end ,it is not possible with the array ,the best way of doing is by using **Single linked lists**.
  * If we want to create the schedulers(for storing the data pertaining to daily activities),the best way of doing this by using **binary heaps**.

 There are some kind of data structures which are specialised.Some other kinds which are generally used like arrays.

 ## Why do we need Data Structures

 As a developer, we will face the situations of handling complicated and complex information,if we should establish different different ways of relationship among the data,we need the kind of data structures based on different situations.
