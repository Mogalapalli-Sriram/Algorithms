# Binary-Search


## Program Statement
Write a function  named binary search which accepts an array and specified number(to be searched) as inputs and returns the index(position) of an element in that array.If no specified number in array, returns  the value -1 ?

## Prerequisites
Browser developer tools

## Run the code
* Copy and Paste the code [binary search]() js file

## Binary Search
* Binary Search is the faster searching algorithm compared to linear search.

* Search of an element can be at any position (eg. middle) of an array ignoring half of  array elements in which specified element is not found.

## Time Complexity of Binary Search and Why binary search
Assume if we have an array of 50 values, if we need to search the end values  of array,we can use Linear Search as well as Binary search. It s not a problem.

Now Assume if we have 10,000 values,now if we need to search the end values using Linear search,it takes a lot of time compared to Binary Search.

 |Search algorithms   |                Time Complexity       | |
 |------------------- |:------------------ |:---------------    |
 |                    |  Worst Case        |          Best Case |
 |Linear search       |  O(N)              |          O(1)      |
 |Binary search       |  O(NlogN)          |          O(1)      |


Even in Worst Case Binary search is better than Linear search since
O(NlogN) < O(N)
